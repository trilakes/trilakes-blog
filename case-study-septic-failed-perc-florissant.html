<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Located in the scenic town of Florissant, Colorado, this beautiful lot presented an appealing opportunity for a new homeowner. However, a significant hurdle arose when the property’s perc test failed, discouraging the previous owner from pursuing construction. Aware of the challenges, our client purchased the lot with the determination to find a viable solution. After careful assessment, we determined that an engineered septic system was the most appropriate solution to transform this "unbuildable" lot into a dream home site.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The primary challenge of the project was the rocky, clay-heavy soil that is prevalent in the Florissant area. During the standard perc test, which measures the soil's ability to absorb water, the results were disappointing: the soil was unable to drain adequately. This failure led to a stigma around the property, causing it to sit unsold on the market for years, labeled as "unbuildable." Despite the negative history, our client recognized the potential of the lot and was determined to explore alternative options for septic system installation. Armed with knowledge about engineered systems, the client approached us with the hope of overcoming the soil's limitations and transforming the lot into a buildable site.</p>

<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>To address the soil challenges, we proposed the installation of an engineered treatment system, specifically an Aerobic Treatment Unit (ATU). This system is designed for sites with difficult soils and limited drainage capabilities. Unlike traditional septic systems, which require a larger drain field and depend heavily on soil absorption, the ATU efficiently treats wastewater through a multi-step process, allowing for a smaller drain field footprint. This was particularly advantageous given the constraints of the lot. By utilizing an ATU, we could maximize the available space and ensure compliance with local health regulations, paving the way for a successful build. Our design included precise calculations and tailored specifications to ensure optimal performance in the rocky, clay-heavy environment.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installation process commenced with thorough planning and coordination with the county's health department to secure the necessary permits. We conducted an extensive site evaluation to determine the optimal location for the ATU and drain field. Once the plans were approved, our team began the installation, which took approximately three weeks to complete. The process involved excavating the designated areas, installing the ATU, and ensuring proper connections to the home site. Throughout the installation, we maintained open communication with the county officials to ensure all standards were met and that inspections would pass smoothly. Our experienced team worked diligently to minimize disruption to the surrounding environment while adhering to strict timelines.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As a result of our engineered septic system solution, the previously “unbuildable” lot is now fully operable and ready for construction. The ATU system passed all inspections, demonstrating its efficacy and compliance with local health requirements. With the septic system successfully installed, the homeowner has begun construction on their dream home, transforming the property into a cherished living space. Analyzing the cost of the engineered system versus the value it provides, the investment has proven worthwhile, as it not only enhanced the property’s potential but also paved the way for a successful build. Our client is now on the path to creating their ideal residence in the beautiful Florissant area, turning a daunting challenge into an exciting opportunity.</p>
