<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Located in the picturesque town of Divide, Colorado, at an elevation of 9,200 feet, this project involved the installation of a cistern system on a 5-acre mountain lot. The property owners were faced with a significant challenge: estimates for well drilling ranged from $40,000 and up due to the substantial depth required for water access in the area. After thorough consideration, they opted for a more predictable solution—a 2,500-gallon cistern system that would serve their needs effectively and affordably.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The property owners were excited to begin construction on their new home situated on raw land, but they quickly discovered that drilling a well could be a daunting and costly endeavor. Research indicated that the typical well depth in the Divide area ranged from 600 to 800 feet, with drilling estimates coming in between $35,000 and $45,000. Even more concerning was the uncertainty of the process; there was no guarantee that a well would yield sufficient water. Faced with these unpredictable costs, the customers were in search of a more reliable and budget-friendly solution to secure their water supply.</p>

<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>To address the customers' needs, we proposed the installation of a 2,500-gallon underground cistern system. This system not only provided a sufficient water supply but was also designed with proper burial depth to ensure frost protection against the harsh mountain winters. Additionally, we incorporated a pump and pressure system to ensure consistent water flow for the property. Considering the unique topography of the land, we also took into account delivery truck access for regular water deliveries, which would be essential for maintaining the cistern's water levels. This comprehensive solution allowed the homeowners to have peace of mind regarding their water supply without the financial burden associated with well drilling.</p>

<h2>Installation Process</h2>
<p>The installation process unfolded over the course of three days, with each day dedicated to specific tasks to ensure a seamless and efficient setup:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Excavation of the site was conducted to create a proper foundation for the cistern. This involved clearing and digging a hole that met the specifications for the tank's size and ensuring adequate drainage.</li>
  <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> The cistern tank was carefully placed into the excavated hole and backfilled with soil to provide stability and insulation against temperature fluctuations.</li>
  <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Our team focused on plumbing installation, connecting the pump and pressure system to the cistern. After the system was set up, we conducted thorough testing to ensure everything was functioning properly before completing the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the end, the total cost for the cistern installation came to approximately $14,000, a stark contrast to the $40,000+ that would have been required for the well drilling gamble. The homeowners now enjoy the benefit of reliable water delivery at a manageable cost of around $200 per month. Reflecting on their decision, they expressed satisfaction, stating, "We wish we had done this from the start." The installation not only provided peace of mind but also allowed them to focus on building their dream mountain home without the looming uncertainty of well drilling hanging over them.</p>
