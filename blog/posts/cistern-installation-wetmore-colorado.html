<h2 id="why-professional">Why Wetmore Properties Need Professional Cistern Installation</h2>
<p>Living in the stunning mountain community of Wetmore, Colorado, where the elevation exceeds 8,000 feet, presents unique challenges for homeowners, especially regarding water supply. Many properties in this area lack direct access to wells, making <strong>cistern installation</strong> an essential service for reliable water access. A properly installed <strong>underground water storage tank</strong> ensures that you have a sufficient supply of <strong>potable water</strong> for your household needs, landscape irrigation, and even livestock if you have a ranch. Engaging a professional <strong>cistern installer</strong> minimizes risks associated with improper installation, such as contamination and structural issues, and ensures compliance with Custer County regulations.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Custer County</h2>
<p>Wetmore's terrain is characterized by rocky granite, decomposed granite, and clay valleys, which can complicate not only excavation but also the overall installation process of a <strong>water cistern</strong>. The depth of the water table often necessitates using cisterns, as many properties require extensive <strong>water hauling</strong>. Additionally, the region's frost line, ranging from 36 to 48 inches, means that your <strong>buried water tank</strong> must be installed well below this line to avoid freezing in the harsh winter months. Access to properties can be limited during winter, making it imperative to consider the size of the system to ensure you have enough water through the colder months. As a homeowner, understanding these challenges will help you make informed decisions regarding your <strong>water storage solutions</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Cistern Installation Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a streamlined process for <strong>cistern installation</strong> to ensure that your system meets all your water needs efficiently. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> We start with a comprehensive assessment of your property, discussing your daily water usage needs and preferences for refill frequency. This helps us determine the ideal size for your <strong>potable water storage tank</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Permitting:</strong> Before any work begins, we secure all necessary permits through the Custer County Building Department, ensuring compliance with local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Site Preparation:</strong> Our team prepares the site, which may involve clearing vegetation and managing rocky terrain. We take care to minimize disruption to your landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Excavation:</strong> Using specialized equipment, we excavate the area for your <strong>underground cistern</strong>. The depth of excavation will depend on soil conditions and frost line requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Tank Installation:</strong> We typically install Norwesco tanks, known for their durability and reliability. This process includes connecting the tank to your home’s water system.</li>
<li><strong>Backfill and Grading:</strong> After installation, we backfill the excavation and grade the area to restore your property’s appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Final Inspection and Water Testing:</strong> We conduct a final inspection to ensure everything meets safety standards and perform any necessary water quality tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire process typically takes 2-3 weeks, depending on site conditions and weather. Our goal is to provide you with a seamless experience, ensuring your <strong>water storage tank installation</strong> is completed efficiently and professionally.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Cistern Installation in Wetmore</h2>
<p>When it comes to <strong>cistern installation</strong> in Wetmore, costs can vary significantly based on several factors, including the size of the <strong>underground water storage tank</strong>, excavation needs, and site accessibility. As a rule of thumb, tank sizing is calculated by the number of bedrooms in your home multiplied by two people per bedroom and then by 100 gallons per day. For example, a 3-bedroom home would require approximately 600 gallons per day, which translates to needing a tank that can accommodate enough water for your usage and refill frequency.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of estimated costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5,000-gallon system:</strong> Starts at $25,000-$35,000, including tank, installation, and necessary components.</li>
<li><strong>10,000-gallon system:</strong> Starts at $40,000-$55,000.</li>
<li><strong>Dual tank systems:</strong> Ranging from $50,000-$75,000+.</li>
<li><strong>Large capacity systems (30,000+ gallons):</strong> Typically $75,000-$120,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional costs may include excavation ($3,000-$8,000+ depending on rocky terrain), pump systems ($2,500-$5,000), trenching ($25-$50 per linear foot), and water filtration ($2,000-$5,000). Keep in mind that rocky or difficult terrain can add 20-40% to excavation costs. It’s essential to budget for these factors to avoid surprises.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions About Cistern Installation</h2>
<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: How much does a cistern cost in Colorado?</h3><p>A: The cost of a cistern in Colorado can vary significantly based on the size and site conditions. For a basic 5,000-gallon system, you can expect to pay between $25,000 and $35,000, while larger systems may start around $40,000 and can go up to $120,000 or more depending on various factors.</p></div>
<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: What size underground water storage tank do I need?</h3><p>A: The size of your underground water storage tank should be determined by your daily water usage and how often you want to refill it. A general guideline is to calculate 100 gallons per day per person, multiplied by the number of residents in your home. For example, a 3-bedroom home with six occupants would require a tank capable of holding at least 18,000 gallons if refilled monthly.</p></div>
<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: How long does cistern installation take?</h3><p>A: The installation process for a cistern typically takes around 2-3 weeks, depending on site access, soil conditions, and weather. Our team at Tri-Lakes Contracting works diligently to minimize disruptions while ensuring your water storage system is installed correctly.</p></div>
<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: Cistern vs well - which is better?</h3><p>A: The choice between a cistern and a well largely depends on your property’s specific conditions. Cisterns are often a better alternative for areas with deep water tables or challenging soil conditions. They provide a reliable backup water supply and are well-suited for off-grid living, while wells may offer ongoing water access but can be expensive and impractical in some locations.</p></div>
