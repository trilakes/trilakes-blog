<h2 id="why-professional">Why Divide Properties Need Professional Cistern Installation</h2>
<p>In the stunning mountain community of Divide, Colorado, with its elevation reaching 9,165 feet, reliable water access is essential. Many properties in this area lack a dependable well, making <strong>cistern installation</strong> a practical solution. With harsh winters and challenging terrain, having a professional cistern installer is crucial to ensure your system is set up correctly, avoids costly mistakes, and meets local regulations. The right installation will not only guarantee a consistent potable water supply but also significantly enhance your property’s value and usability.</p>
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we understand the unique needs of mountain properties. Our expert team specializes in underground water storage tanks, ensuring that you have a safe, reliable backup water supply. With our thorough understanding of local building codes and conditions, we ensure that your <strong>water storage tank installation</strong> is seamless and stress-free.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Teller County</h2>
<p>Divide's high alpine environment presents specific challenges for <strong>cistern installation</strong>. The rocky granite terrain and varying soil types, including clay in valleys, often complicate excavation efforts. Many properties require engineered septic systems due to these challenging soil conditions, which can also affect the installation of an <strong>underground cistern</strong>.</p>
<p>The water table in Teller County can be quite deep, making wells impractical for many homeowners. Instead, <strong>water hauling</strong> or installing a buried water tank becomes essential for reliable access to potable water. Additionally, with a frost line of 36-48 inches, ensuring that your cistern is properly installed for freeze protection is vital. The extreme weather conditions, including heavy snowfall and temperature swings, further emphasize the need for professional expertise to ensure your <strong>water storage solutions</strong> are robust and effective.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Cistern Installation Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a thorough process to ensure your <strong>cistern installation</strong> meets all your needs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> We assess your property, discuss your water needs, and review local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Site Evaluation:</strong> Our team examines soil conditions, accessibility, and specific site challenges to determine the best location for your <strong>underground water storage tank</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Design and Planning:</strong> We provide a detailed plan outlining the system size based on your daily water usage and refill preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Permitting:</strong> We assist you with obtaining necessary permits from the Teller County Building Department to ensure compliance with local codes (<a href="https://www.co.teller.co.us/Building/">Building Department</a>).</li>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Cistern Installation in Divide</h2>
<p>The cost of <strong>cistern installation</strong> in Divide can vary significantly based on several factors. The size of your cistern is primarily determined by your daily water usage, which is typically calculated at 100 gallons per person per day. For example, a 3-bedroom home with an assumed occupancy of six people would require approximately 600 gallons per day, leading to a minimum tank size of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refill every 2 weeks: 8,400 gallons minimum</li>
<li>Refill monthly: 18,000 gallons minimum</li>
<li>Refill every 2-3 months: 36,000-54,000 gallons</li>
<li>To get through winter (4-5 months): 72,000+ gallons (often requiring multiple tanks)</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically install Norwesco tanks, known for their durability and reliability. A 5,000-gallon tank costs between $13,000-$15,000, while a 10,000-gallon tank ranges from $22,000-$28,000. In addition to the tank cost, several other factors will influence your total installation expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excavation Costs:</strong> Depending on the terrain, excavation can range from $3,000 to $8,000 or more due to rocky conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Pumping System and Accessories:</strong> Expect to pay between $2,500 and $5,000 for a pump and pressure tank.</li>
<li><strong>Trenching to the House:</strong> This costs approximately $25-$50 per linear foot.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Components:</strong> Risers, access lids, and electrical work can add anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 to your total costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these factors, the total installed system costs can range from $25,000 to over $120,000, depending on your specific needs and site conditions. Always keep in mind that rocky terrain and difficult access can add 20-40% to your overall costs.</p>
