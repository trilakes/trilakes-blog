<h2 id="why-professional">Why Howard Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
<p>Building a custom home in Howard, Colorado, an area known for its stunning mountain views and breathtaking landscapes, requires specialized knowledge and expertise. With an elevation exceeding 8,000 feet, the unique challenges posed by this mountainous terrain demand a professional custom home builder who understands local building codes, environmental factors, and construction techniques. Tri-Lakes Contracting, as a licensed and insured general contractor, is equipped to handle the complexities of home construction in this region. Our comprehensive approach ensures that every home we build not only meets your dreams but also withstands the harsh elements typical of the Colorado mountains.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Fremont County</h2>
<p>The stunning beauty of Fremont County comes with its set of challenges for custom home construction. The soil here varies from rocky granite to decomposed granite and clay, which significantly impacts foundation engineering and septic system installation. With a frost line that can reach depths of 36-48 inches, proper planning and implementation of building strategies are essential to prevent future structural issues. Additionally, the area's steep driveways can complicate access, especially during winter months when snow can accumulate heavily. The intense weather patterns, including afternoon thunderstorms and significant temperature swings, further emphasize the need for fire-resistant construction and effective winterization techniques. Our expertise as a local general contractor ensures that these challenges are met head-on, providing you with a reliable and enduring mountain home.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a meticulous step-by-step process for custom home construction to ensure your vision becomes a reality. Here’s how we do it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study:</strong> This is essential before purchasing land to determine if it’s suitable for your dream home.</li>
<li><strong>Well Permit:</strong> If you are planning to drill a well, securing this permit early is crucial, as wait times can stretch to over a year.</li>
<li><strong>Site Plan:</strong> We create a detailed site plan that outlines the house's footprint, utility routes, and drainage patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural Plans:</strong> Choose from our network of architects or use resources like <a href="https://www.architecturaldesigns.com" target="_blank">ArchitecturalDesigns.com</a> for ready-made plans.</li>
<li><strong>Engineered Foundation & Framing Plans:</strong> These are critical for ensuring your home can withstand Colorado's unique conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Land Survey:</strong> A professional survey validates property boundaries and identifies easements.</li>
<li><strong>Septic System Plans:</strong> Required if no sewer connection is available, ensuring compliance with local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Compile & Submit for Building Permit:</strong> We handle all documentation for permit approval through the Fremont County Building Department.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Construction Planning:</strong> Final reviews and scheduling take place, ensuring everything is in place before construction begins.</li>
<li><strong>Construction:</strong> The actual building process involves multiple inspections to ensure quality and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate of Occupancy:</strong> Once completed, we perform a final walkthrough, and you receive your keys to your new home!</li>
</ol>
<p>This comprehensive process typically spans several months and is designed to navigate the complexities of mountain home construction effectively.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Howard</h2>
<p>The cost of building a custom home in Howard varies significantly based on several factors, and at Tri-Lakes Contracting, we emphasize transparency regarding pricing. For basic construction, expect costs to start from $350 to $450 per square foot, while standard quality builds range from $450 to $550 per square foot. For custom or higher-end homes, pricing typically starts from $550 up to $700 per square foot, with luxury builds potentially exceeding $1,000 per square foot. Additional costs include land acquisition, which is not included in these estimates, as well as cistern installation ranging from $25,000 to $75,000, depending on the size and configuration. A good rule of thumb for cistern sizing is to calculate based on the number of bedrooms: two people per bedroom at 100 gallons per day.</p>
<p>Factors that can increase costs significantly are rocky terrain, access issues, and the need for engineered septic systems due to challenging soil conditions. Being upfront about these variables allows you to better plan your budget and ensure successful project completion.</p>
