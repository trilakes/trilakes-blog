<h1>Before You Buy Land in Colorado Mountains</h1>

Buying land in the Colorado mountains can be a dream come true, but it’s essential to navigate the complexities of mountain property ownership wisely. At Tri-Lakes, we pride ourselves on being your trusted advisor in this journey. This guide will help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure you make a prudent investment.

<h2>The Hidden Costs of "Cheap" Mountain Land</h2>
Purchasing a seemingly inexpensive mountain lot—like that $50k parcel—could lead to unexpected expenses that quickly balloon the overall cost. It’s essential to ask: What makes land truly buildable? 

Many lots require significant site work to prepare them for construction. This includes grading, clearing trees, installing drainage systems, and more, which can easily add $80k or more to your initial investment. 

Due diligence is your best ally here. Research zoning laws, soil types, and building regulations to uncover any hidden issues. A lot that looks good on paper may have underlying problems, such as unstable soil or limited access, which can lead to costly surprises down the line. Conduct thorough research and hire professionals to assess the land before signing on the dotted line; it could save you a fortune.

<h2>Water: The Most Critical Question</h2>
When considering mountain land, ask yourself: Can you drill a well? Water is often the most critical utility you need to evaluate. The depth and cost of drilling a well can vary significantly, and understanding this is crucial for budget planning.

You might face a choice between a cistern and a well. A cistern can be a temporary solution, but long-term, a well is usually more reliable and cost-effective. Researching neighboring wells can provide insight into what to expect. Well permits are public records, so check to see how deep nearby wells had to drill and the associated costs.

Water rights are another crucial consideration. In Colorado, water rights can be complicated, and understanding these rights can impact your ability to access water for your property.

Taking the time to research water availability and rights can save you from future headaches and financial burdens.

<h2>Septic: Will Your Land Perc?</h2>
One of the most critical questions when purchasing mountain land is whether your land can support a septic system. A perc test (percolation test) assesses the soil's ability to absorb water, which is vital for septic systems.

If you can, conduct a perc test before buying; usually, this is possible with the current owner’s permission. If the land fails the test, you may need to invest in an engineered system, which can be significantly more expensive than a standard septic system.

Be on the lookout for red flags in the soil and terrain that might indicate drainage issues, such as standing water or overly rocky ground. These factors can complicate or even prevent the installation of a septic system.

<h2>Access: Can You Actually Get There?</h2>
Not all access is created equal. Legal access to your property does not guarantee that you can physically access it, especially in winter months when snow can block roads. 

Consider the costs associated with constructing a driveway, which can range anywhere from $20k to $50k or more depending on the terrain and distance from the main road. Understanding easements and road maintenance obligations is essential; these can impact your ongoing costs and access.

When evaluating the property, assess both summer and winter access thoroughly. A site visit during winter months can help you gauge the accessibility of your new property.

<h2>Utilities & Infrastructure</h2>
Utilities can be a significant consideration when buying land in the mountains. Electric service costs will vary depending on how far you are from existing lines. 

While natural gas is available in some areas, many mountain properties rely on propane for heating. This can be a more cost-effective solution in remote areas. Internet options can also be limited at higher elevations, so it’s imperative to research what is available to ensure you can stay connected.

<h2>Setbacks, Easements & Buildable Area</h2>
Before purchasing mountain land, familiarize yourself with county setback requirements. Setbacks dictate how far structures must be from property lines and roads, affecting your buildable area.

Additionally, utility easements may affect where you can build. Understanding the actual buildable footprint of your property is crucial, as it may be significantly smaller than the total land area due to these regulations.

<h2>Your Pre-Purchase Checklist</h2>
Here's a handy checklist to guide you through the pre-purchase process:

1. Verify zoning regulations and land use.
2. Confirm access rights: legal vs. physical access.
3. Research nearby water sources and well depth.
4. Conduct a perc test for septic suitability.
5. Assess the cost and feasibility of site work.
6. Review utility availability and costs (electric, gas, internet).
7. Understand easements and setback requirements.
8. Examine soil quality and drainage issues.
9. Investigate any potential hazards (landslides, flooding).
10. Check property taxes and HOA regulations (if applicable).
11. Speak with neighbors about their experiences with the land.
12. Consult with a local contractor for insights on buildability.
13. Confirm the status of any existing structures (if applicable).
14. Obtain a title report to check for any liens or encumbrances.
