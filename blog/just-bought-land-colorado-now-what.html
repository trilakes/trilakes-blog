<h2>Congratulations! Now Let's Make It Buildable</h2>
<p>Congratulations on your recent purchase of Colorado mountain land! This is an exciting time filled with possibilities, but it also comes with a myriad of considerations to ensure your land is buildable and suits your needs. Whether you're planning to build a vacation retreat or a permanent residence, it's crucial to navigate the necessary steps in the right order. This guide will walk you through everything you need to do immediately after your purchase, so you can turn your dream into reality efficiently and effectively.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Get Your Survey (If You Haven't Already)</h2>
<p>The first step in making your land buildable is to confirm the boundaries. A professional land survey will provide you with the legal boundaries of your property, which is essential for any future construction. It's also important to identify any setbacks—these are the distances you must maintain from property lines when building. Additionally, the survey will locate any easements, which are rights of way that may affect how and where you can build. Expect to pay between $500 and $1,500 for a survey, depending on the size and location of your land. This investment is crucial for avoiding future disputes and complications.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Research Your Water Options</h2>
<p>Water is a critical resource for any property, and understanding your options is vital before you start building. Begin by researching well depths in your area using resources like <a href="https://www.coloradowell.com" target="_blank">ColoradoWell.com</a>. This site provides valuable information on existing wells and their depths, helping you determine the feasibility of drilling your own well. Additionally, it's beneficial to talk to your neighbors about their experiences with their wells; they can provide insights into water quality and availability. If drilling isn't a viable option, consider a cistern for storing water. However, avoid drilling until you have a clear plan in place to ensure that your water needs are met effectively.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Perc Test for Septic</h2>
<p>Before you can build, you'll need to conduct a percolation (perc) test to determine the suitability of your land for a septic system. This test is required by your county's environmental health department and will help identify the type of septic system that will work best for your property. It's essential to do this early in the process as the results can significantly affect where you place your house on the land. Failing to account for the perc test could lead to costly adjustments later on, so be proactive and ensure this step is completed as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Evaluate Access</h2>
<p>Access to your property is crucial, especially in a mountainous region. Assess whether you can reach your land year-round or if seasonal weather might create obstacles. You may need to consider driveway construction; if so, obtaining quotes early can help you budget accordingly. The type and quality of access can affect not just your building plans, but also your enjoyment of the property. Make sure you have a clear understanding of what is required to ensure reliable access, especially during winter months.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Talk to a Contractor</h2>
<p>Engaging with a contractor early in the process can provide you with invaluable insights into your build. A professional can conduct a site evaluation, giving you a realistic timeline for construction and budget expectations. For those in the Tri-Lakes area, there are options for free site consultations. This can be a wonderful opportunity to identify challenges and opportunities specific to your property, ensuring that you're well-prepared before breaking ground.</p>

<h2>Step 6: County Building Department</h2>
<p>Every county has its own set of building codes and permit requirements, so it's essential to connect with your local building department as soon as possible. They can provide you with information on the necessary permits, timelines, and any specific regulations that may apply to your property. Understanding these requirements upfront can save you time and headaches later in the building process. For more specific information, consider visiting our county guides linked here.</p>

<h2>Your First Year Timeline</h2>
<p>Here’s a month-by-month breakdown of what to expect in your first year as a new landowner:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Get your survey and begin your water research.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Conduct your perc test and evaluate access options.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Begin discussions with contractors and the county building department.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> Finalize your water source and driveway plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 5:</strong> Apply for necessary permits and finalize your building plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> Prepare your land for construction, including any required site work.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 7:</strong> Begin construction of your new home or cabin.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 8-12:</strong> Continue construction, oversee project progress, and make adjustments as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following this timeline, you can stay organized and ensure that you're making steady progress towards your building goals.</p>
