<h2 id="why-professional">Why Florence Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
<p>Building a custom home in Florence, known as the "Antique Capital of Colorado," requires a nuanced understanding of the unique challenges posed by its elevation of 5,187 feet and its specific terrain. With rocky soil and the potential for extreme temperature fluctuations, working with a professional <strong>custom home builder</strong> is crucial. At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our team of licensed and insured general contractors brings extensive experience in navigating the complexities of <strong>home construction</strong> in this historic town. From ensuring compliance with local building codes to optimizing designs for energy efficiency, our expertise helps you create a dream mountain home that withstands the test of time.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Fremont County</h2>
<p>Florence's challenging landscape presents a variety of obstacles that must be addressed during the custom home building process. The rocky granite and decomposed granite soils, common in the area, often necessitate specialized <strong>foundation engineering</strong> to ensure stability and durability. Additionally, the deep water table may require homeowners to invest in cisterns or water hauling systems, further complicating site planning. The frost line, ranging from 36 to 48 inches, is another critical factor to consider, particularly for foundation depth. Moreover, winter access can be limited due to steep driveways and heavy snow loads, highlighting the importance of working with a <strong>residential contractor</strong> experienced in <strong>new construction</strong> in high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a comprehensive step-by-step process to ensure your custom home construction is efficient and successful. Our journey begins with a <strong>pre-purchase property inspection</strong> or a <a href="/blog/build-feasibility-report-colorado.html">Build Feasibility Report</a> to assess the site and confirm its buildability. Next, we file for a well or cistern permit early in the process, as water access is crucial for receiving a building permit in Fremont County.</p>
<p>Our team then develops a detailed site plan, showcasing your home’s footprint, driveway access, and utility routes. This is followed by the creation of architectural plans that meet your design specifications. Once we have stamped engineering for foundations and framing plans, we conduct a professional land survey to verify property boundaries. After compiling necessary documentation, we submit for a building permit through the Fremont County Building Department.</p>
<p>Once you have your permit, we meticulously prepare for construction, establishing timelines and budgets. The actual construction phase includes multiple inspections to ensure quality and compliance. Finally, once the home passes the final inspection, you will receive your <strong>certificate of occupancy</strong>, signaling that your dream home is ready for you to move in.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Florence</h2>
<p>When planning your custom home construction, understanding the costs involved is vital. The typical cost per square foot for basic builds in Colorado's mountains starts at approximately $350 and can go as high as $450, while standard quality homes range from $450 to $550 per square foot. For higher-end custom builds, prices can climb to $700 or more per square foot.</p>
<p>For instance, a 2,000 square foot custom home could cost anywhere from $700,000 to $1,100,000, not including land purchase. Additional costs to consider include cistern installation, which typically ranges from $25,000 to $75,000, and septic systems, costing between $35,000 to $80,000. If you're considering a cistern, remember the sizing formula: bedroom count multiplied by two people per bedroom multiplied by 100 gallons per day.</p>
<p>Factors that can increase costs include challenging terrain with rocky soil, steep access drives, and the need for specialized building permits. Therefore, it’s crucial to consult with an experienced <strong>custom home builder</strong> like Tri-Lakes Contracting to navigate these complexities effectively.</p>
