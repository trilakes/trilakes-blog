<h2 id="why-professional">Why Stratmoor Hills Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
Building a custom home in Stratmoor Hills, located at an elevation of over 8,000 feet, presents unique opportunities and challenges. The breathtaking views and serene mountain setting are enticing; however, the complexities of Colorado's mountain terrain necessitate a professional touch. As a licensed and insured general contractor, Tri-Lakes Contracting specializes in custom home construction that harmonizes with the natural landscape while adhering to local building codes and regulations. Our expertise ensures that your dream home is not only aesthetically pleasing but also structurally sound and energy-efficient. Choosing a reputable custom home builder like us means you will benefit from a streamlined process, compliance with essential permits, and the peace of mind that comes from knowing your home is built to endure the elements.

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in El Paso County</h2>
The Stratmoor Hills area poses distinct challenges for home construction, primarily due to its rocky granite soil and varying elevation. Properties often require engineered septic systems due to the challenging soil conditions, and a deep water table may necessitate the installation of cisterns for water storage. Additionally, the frost line at this elevation can reach depths of 36-48 inches, impacting foundation engineering and design. The steep driveways common in this mountainous region can limit winter access, making proper planning essential. Moreover, the extreme weather conditions, including heavy snow loads and afternoon thunderstorms, require fire-resistant construction techniques and careful site planning to create defensible space around your home. Understanding these factors is crucial for any homeowner looking to build a custom mountain home in this beautiful area.

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a comprehensive and structured process for custom home construction. It begins with a <strong>pre-purchase build feasibility report</strong> to assess the site's viability. This includes a site visit, setback analysis, soil conditions evaluation, and a water flow analysis, costing between $1,500-$3,500. Next, we help you navigate the well permitting process, which must be completed before applying for a building permit. 

Once you have secured your water source, we create a detailed site plan that outlines everything from the house footprint to utility routes, costing around $1,500-$4,000. Following this, architectural plans are developed, which can be sourced from your architect, our network, or through our affiliate at <a href="https://www.architecturaldesigns.com" target="_blank">ArchitecturalDesigns.com</a>. The cost of these plans typically ranges from $2,000-$15,000+.

Next, we focus on engineered foundation and framing plans, which are stamped by licensed engineers, costing approximately $5,000-$15,000. A land survey follows, ensuring accurate boundaries and topographical data, with costs of $1,500-$5,000. 

Once these plans are in place, we compile and submit all necessary documents to the El Paso County Building Department, with permit fees ranging from $5,000-$20,000. This process takes 2-8 weeks. After securing your building permit, we move into the pre-construction phase, finalizing details and preparing for construction, which can take between 10-18 months depending on the complexity of your home.

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Stratmoor Hills</h2>
When considering the cost of building a custom home in Stratmoor Hills, it’s important to account for various factors that influence the overall price. Basic construction starts around $350-$450 per square foot, while standard quality builds are typically priced between $450-$550 per square foot. For custom or higher-end projects, costs can escalate to $550-$700 per square foot, and luxury builds can reach $700-$1,000+ per square foot.

For example, if you are planning a 2,500 square foot home, the typical cost would range from $875,000 to $1,375,000. In addition, homeowners should budget for additional costs such as land, which varies widely, as well as water solutions like cisterns ($25,000-$75,000) and wells ($30,000-$80,000). 

For water storage, the sizing of your cistern is crucial and is usually calculated based on the number of bedrooms in your home. You would determine the tank size needed by multiplying the bedroom count by two people per bedroom and then by 100 gallons per day.

Moreover, factors such as rocky terrain, difficult access, and the need for engineered septic systems can significantly impact construction costs, adding to the complexity and expense of your project.
