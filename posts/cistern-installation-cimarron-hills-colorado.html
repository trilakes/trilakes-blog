<h2 id="why-professional">Why Cimarron Hills Properties Need Professional Cistern Installation</h2>
<p>Cimarron Hills is a breathtaking mountain community located at an elevation of over 8,000 feet, where access to reliable water sources can be a challenge. Many homes in this area do not have wells, making <strong>cistern installation</strong> a vital solution for ensuring a consistent water supply. Professional installation is crucial for several reasons: it guarantees adherence to local regulations, provides expert knowledge about the unique challenges of the mountain terrain, and ensures that your <strong>underground water storage tank</strong> is installed safely and efficiently. Moreover, as a licensed and insured general contractor, Tri-Lakes Contracting understands the complexities of the local environment and offers tailored <strong>water storage solutions</strong> that meet your specific needs, from residential to agricultural water storage.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in El Paso County</h2>
<p>In Cimarron Hills, the <strong>rocky granite</strong> and <strong>decomposed granite</strong> soil can pose significant challenges for <strong>water storage tank installation</strong>. The water table is often deep, making it impractical for many properties to rely solely on wells for their water supply. This frequently leads homeowners to opt for a <strong>water cistern</strong> instead. The frost line in this region ranges from 36 to 48 inches, necessitating special attention to freeze protection during installation, especially as winter approaches. Add to this the steep driveways and limited winter access that many properties face, and you have a compelling case for hiring a professional <strong>cistern installer near me</strong> who understands these local dynamics. Additionally, El Paso County requires permits for cistern installations, making it essential to work with a contractor familiar with local regulations and the permit application process.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Cistern Installation Process</h2>
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our <strong>cistern installation</strong> process is designed to be efficient and thorough, ensuring your system meets your water needs while adhering to all local regulations. The first step involves a consultation where we assess your property, discuss your water usage, and determine the appropriate size for your <strong>potable water storage tank</strong>. We utilize the formula of bedroom count multiplied by two people per bedroom, then multiplied by 100 gallons per day to ensure you have ample water supply.</p>

<p>Next, we conduct a soil analysis to understand the excavation challenges. Given the rocky terrain, this step is crucial for determining excavation costs and logistics. After obtaining the necessary permits from El Paso County, we schedule the excavation, which typically takes place during the May-October building season to avoid harsh winter conditions.</p>

<p>Once excavation is complete, we carefully install the <strong>buried water tank</strong>, ensuring that it is properly connected to your home’s water system. This includes integrating a pump system, pressure tank, and any necessary water filtration or treatment options. Finally, we conduct a thorough check of the entire system to ensure everything is functioning as intended. This process can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on site conditions and tank size.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Cistern Installation in Cimarron Hills</h2>
<p>The cost of <strong>cistern installation</strong> in Cimarron Hills varies based on several factors, including soil type, access to the site, and the tank's size. When considering a <strong>water storage tank installation</strong>, it’s essential to account for all components of the system. For example, a 5,000-gallon Norwesco tank typically costs between $13,000 and $15,000, while a 10,000-gallon tank ranges from $22,000 to $28,000. Additional costs may include excavation, which can range from $3,000 to $8,000, especially in rocky terrain, as well as pumps and electrical installations.</p>

<p>To calculate the necessary tank size, consider your household's daily water usage, which averages around 100 gallons per person per day. For instance, a 3-bedroom home with six occupants would require a minimum of 600 gallons per day, suggesting a tank size suited for at least 18,000 gallons if you refill monthly. Larger systems, designed to last through winter, can reach 72,000 gallons or more, often requiring multiple tanks. These systems can cost between $50,000 and $120,000 when fully installed.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions About Cistern Installation</h2>
<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: How much does a cistern cost in Colorado?</h3><p>A: The cost of a cistern installation in Colorado can range significantly based on the system's size and site conditions. A basic 5,000-gallon system can start around $25,000, while larger systems can exceed $75,000. It's essential to factor in additional costs such as excavation, pumps, and electrical work, which can add thousands to the total price.</p></div>

<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: What size underground water storage tank do I need?</h3><p>A: The size of your underground water storage tank should be based on your household's daily water usage. A simple calculation involves taking the number of bedrooms, multiplying by two for occupants, and then multiplying by 100 gallons per day. For example, a 3-bedroom home would need a minimum of 18,000 gallons for monthly refills.</p></div>

<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: How long does cistern installation take?</h3><p>A: The installation timeline for a cistern can vary but typically ranges from several days to a few weeks, depending on site conditions and tank size. Factors such as excavation challenges and obtaining permits from El Paso County can also affect the overall time required to complete the installation.</p></div>

<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: Cistern vs well - which is better?</h3><p>A: The choice between a cistern and a well largely depends on your property's unique characteristics. For properties with deep water tables or rocky terrain, a <strong>cistern installation</strong> may be a more practical solution, especially for reliable water access during winter months. A well can provide a continuous supply, but if it is too deep or yields insufficient water, a cistern becomes the better option.</p></div>
