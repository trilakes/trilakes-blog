<h2 id="why-professional">Why Howard Properties Need Professional Septic System Installation</h2>
<p>Living in the breathtaking mountain community of Howard, Colorado, offers unparalleled scenic views and outdoor adventures. However, the unique high-elevation environment necessitates professional <strong>septic installation</strong> services to ensure your systems function reliably. At an elevation of over 8,000 feet, the soil conditions, water table depth, and seasonal weather fluctuations present specific challenges that an experienced <strong>septic installer</strong> understands deeply. Attempting to handle the complexities of a <strong>septic system</strong> installation without professional help can lead to costly mistakes and operational failures, potentially impacting your property value and local groundwater quality.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Fremont County</h2>
<p>Constructing a <strong>septic system</strong> in Fremont County involves navigating several challenges unique to the area. The rocky granite and clay soils can complicate the installation process, often requiring engineered systems to accommodate these conditions. The water table tends to be quite deep in Howard, which may necessitate additional measures like cisterns for water storage. Moreover, the frost line in this mountainous region can reach depths of 36-48 inches, necessitating careful planning to protect your system from freeze damage during the winter months. With steep driveways and limited access during snowy conditions, the logistics of <strong>septic installation</strong> require careful consideration to avoid delays and additional costs.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Septic System Installation Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our <strong>septic installation</strong> process is designed to ensure every aspect of the project is handled with precision and care. Here’s how we do it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> We start with a site visit to discuss your needs and evaluate your property.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Testing:</strong> Utilizing a mini excavator, we dig two test holes, each 8 feet deep, to gather soil samples for analysis by a licensed engineer. This step is crucial as it determines the type of system necessary for your property.</li>
<li><strong>System Design:</strong> Based on the soil report, we design an appropriate <strong>onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS)</strong>, ensuring compliance with Colorado's Regulation 43.</li>
<li><strong>Permitting:</strong> We assist you in navigating the Fremont County Building Department for necessary permits, which can vary in cost from $500 to $2,000.</li>
<li><strong>Installation:</strong> Our team handles all aspects of installation, including excavation, tank placement, and installation of the leach field or drain field.</li>
<li><strong>Inspection:</strong> After installation, we schedule a septic inspection to ensure everything meets regulatory standards.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Planning:</strong> We provide recommendations for ongoing maintenance to keep your system running smoothly for years to come.</li>
</ol>
<p>This comprehensive process typically takes several weeks from consultation to completion, depending on site conditions and weather.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Septic System Installation in Howard</h2>
<p>Understanding the costs involved in <strong>septic installation</strong> is crucial for Howard residents. The total cost typically starts from the high end due to the challenging conditions presented in our mountain terrain. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soil Testing + Engineering:</strong> $2,000 - $4,000</li>
<li><strong>Permits:</strong> $500 - $2,000 (required by the Fremont County Building Department)</li>
<li><strong>Excavation for System:</strong> $8,000 - $20,000+</li>
<li><strong>Tank + Components:</strong> $5,000 - $15,000</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Treatment Unit (if required):</strong> $8,000 - $15,000</li>
<li><strong>Electrical/Controls:</strong> $2,000 - $4,000</li>
</ul>
<p>For most properties in Howard, the total installed costs can range from $35,000 to $80,000+, especially if rocky terrain increases excavation challenges. Notably, for cisterns, the size is determined based on the bedroom count (2 people per bedroom x 100 gallons/day).</p>
