<h2 id="why-professional">Why Howard Properties Need Professional Septic System Installation</h2>
<p>Installing a <strong>septic system</strong> in Howard, located at an elevation of 8,000+ feet, requires special expertise tailored to the unique challenges posed by the mountain terrain. The combination of rocky granite and clay soils, along with deep water tables, means that most properties here require an <strong>engineered septic</strong> solution rather than a conventional system. Professionals like Tri-Lakes Contracting bring the necessary experience to ensure compliance with Colorado's strict <strong>Onsite Wastewater Treatment System (OWTS)</strong> regulations under Regulation 43, allowing for a smooth installation process that protects both your property and the environment.</p>
<p>Moreover, having a licensed and insured <strong>septic installer</strong> ensures that your system will be built to last, particularly in Howard’s extreme weather conditions. Winterization is critical, and our experts will provide essential tips for <strong>winterizing your septic system installation</strong> to prevent freezing, which can lead to costly repairs and disruptions.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Fremont County</h2>
<p>Fremont County’s unique geological and meteorological conditions present several challenges for <strong>septic installation</strong>. The rocky granite and decomposed granite soil types found throughout Howard often require specific <strong>septic designs</strong> to ensure proper functionality. Additionally, the water table can be significantly deep, meaning many properties will need cisterns for water storage and hauling.</p>
<p>The frost line in this area extends 36 to 48 inches, making excavation and installation more complex—especially as the building season is typically limited to May through October at higher elevations. Access can also be tricky, with steep driveways that can hinder construction, particularly during winter. Furthermore, fire mitigation is crucial in this forested landscape, necessitating defensible space around your property while planning your <strong>septic system</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Septic System Installation Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our <strong>septic installation</strong> process begins with a comprehensive site assessment. First, we perform <strong>soil testing</strong> rather than traditional perc tests. Our team utilizes a mini excavator to dig two test holes, each reaching eight feet deep, allowing us to collect soil samples that are sent to a licensed engineer for analysis.</p>
<p>Once we receive the soils report, we can determine the best type of <strong>septic system</strong> for your property. This is followed by applying for the necessary <strong>septic permit</strong> through the Fremont County Building Department, as all installations must comply with local regulations. Next, we schedule excavation, which typically involves preparing the site for the tank installation and leach field. Depending on the system type—whether it’s a pressure-dosed system, a sand filter system, or an advanced treatment unit (ATU)—the installation timeline may vary.</p>
<p>After completing the installation, our team conducts a thorough <strong>septic inspection</strong> to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Homeowners are then educated on system maintenance, including how to properly use and care for their new <strong>onsite wastewater</strong> system.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Septic System Installation in Howard</h2>
<p>The total cost for <strong>septic installation</strong> in Howard can vary significantly based on several factors, including soil conditions, access to the site, and specific system requirements. Generally, a basic engineered system starts from $35,000 to $50,000, while the more complex sand filter systems range from $45,000 to $65,000. For the advanced treatment units (ATU), which are often necessary for smaller lots with stricter regulations, costs can escalate to $55,000 to $80,000+.</p>
<p>When considering a cistern for water storage, remember that the size should be based on your bedroom count—specifically, 2 people per bedroom at 100 gallons per day. Therefore, if you have 3 bedrooms, you would need a cistern capable of holding 600 gallons. Other factors that can contribute to increased costs include rocky terrain, challenging access, and any additional excavation required—potentially adding $10,000 to $25,000 to the final price.</p>
<p>It’s essential to account for soils testing and engineering costs, which typically range from $2,000 to $4,000, as well as permits that can vary from $500 to $2,000. For a detailed breakdown of costs, check our <a href="/blog/septic-cost-colorado-2024.html">Septic Cost Guide</a>.</p>
