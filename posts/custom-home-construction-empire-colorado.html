<h2 id="why-professional">Why Empire Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
Building a custom home in Empire, Colorado, with its breathtaking mountain views and elevation exceeding 8,000 feet, requires a specialized approach. As a dedicated **custom home builder**, Tri-Lakes Contracting understands the unique challenges of constructing in this mountainous terrain, such as rocky soil conditions and the need for engineered foundations. Our expertise ensures that your home meets not just aesthetic desires but also the stringent local building codes and environmental factors unique to **Clear Creek County**. From design to final inspection, we guide you through every step, making the process seamless and efficient.

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Clear Creek County</h2>
Empire is known for its stunning vistas, but building here comes with its own set of challenges. The **rocky granite** and **decomposed granite** soil prevalent in the area can complicate foundation engineering, often requiring deeper footings to accommodate the frost line, which can reach up to 48 inches at higher elevations. Additionally, many properties have steep driveways, making access limited during winter months when heavy snow can obstruct paths. These factors necessitate a thorough **site planning** process, which includes detailed **topographic surveys** and **water flow analysis** to ensure proper drainage and mitigate flooding issues. Furthermore, securing the necessary **building permits** through the Clear Creek County Building Department can be a lengthy process, often taking several weeks, so planning ahead is crucial.

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a comprehensive and structured approach to custom home construction. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of our process:

1. **Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study**: Before you even buy land, we conduct a feasibility study to assess the viability of your desired property. This includes site visits, setback analyses, and evaluations of soil conditions and utility availability.
2. **Well or Cistern Permit**: Water is a critical element for any construction project. We help you file for a well permit or opt for a cistern, which allows you to start building sooner.
3. **Site Plan Creation**: Our team prepares a professional site plan that outlines the house footprint, driveway, and utility routes, ensuring all local setback requirements are met.
4. **Architectural Plans**: Whether you choose your own architect or work with our recommended partners, we ensure your plans fit your vision and local regulations.
5. **Engineered Foundation Plans**: We coordinate with licensed engineers to create stamped foundation plans tailored to your land's unique conditions.
6. **Land Survey**: A professional land survey is essential for verifying boundaries and identifying easements.
7. **Septic System Plans**: If your property is off the sewer grid, we develop engineered septic plans that comply with local regulations.
8. **Building Permit Submission**: We compile all necessary documents and submit them to the Clear Creek County Building Department for permit approval.
9. **Pre-Construction Planning**: Before commencing construction, we finalize material orders, subcontractor schedules, and construction timelines.
10. **Construction Phase**: We manage the construction process, ensuring each phase is completed to the highest standards, with inspections conducted at critical milestones.
11. **Certificate of Occupancy**: After passing the final inspection, we obtain the Certificate of Occupancy, allowing you to move into your new mountain home!

The typical construction timeline can vary, but expect approximately 10-18 months once building begins, depending on the complexity of your project and local weather conditions.

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Empire</h2>
When considering custom home construction, it’s vital to understand the cost implications. The average cost per square foot for building in the Colorado mountains can range significantly based on various factors. For instance:

- **Basic build**: $350-$450/sq ft
- **Standard quality**: $450-$550/sq ft
- **Custom/higher-end**: $550-$700/sq ft
- **Luxury/high-end**: $700-$1,000+/sq ft

For a typical home, you can expect costs to break down like this:
- A 1,500 sq ft home might cost between $525,000 and $825,000.
- A 2,000 sq ft home typically ranges from $700,000 to $1,100,000.
- Larger homes will naturally increase in cost, especially with factors like rocky terrain and limited access.

If you opt for a cistern, remember the sizing formula: for every bedroom, plan on 2 people per room at 100 gallons per day, impacting your overall costs significantly. Don’t forget to budget for **additional costs** such as land acquisition, septic installation, driveway construction, and utility extensions, which can vary widely based on site conditions.
