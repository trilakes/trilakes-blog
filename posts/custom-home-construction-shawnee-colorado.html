<h2 id="why-professional">Why Shawnee Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
Building a custom home in Shawnee, Colorado, means embracing the unique mountain lifestyle while navigating the challenges of high-elevation construction. With an elevation of over 8,000 feet, properties here face specific demands including weather variations, soil characteristics, and accessibility concerns. As a licensed and insured general contractor, Tri-Lakes Contracting understands that the right expertise is crucial for a successful custom home build. From fire-resistant construction to energy-efficient designs suitable for mountain environments, our team is dedicated to ensuring your mountain home not only meets your aesthetic desires but also withstands the rigors of Colorado's climate. 

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Park County County</h2>
In Shawnee, building a custom home comes with its set of challenges. The local terrain is often rocky with granite outcroppings, and soil types can include decomposed granite and clay in the valleys—factors that significantly impact foundation engineering and septic system planning. With a deep water table, many properties will require cisterns for water storage, complicating the home construction process further. Additionally, the frost line here reaches depths of 36-48 inches, meaning foundations must be engineered to withstand freezing temperatures. The winter months can also bring heavy snow loads and access issues, as many properties feature steep driveways that may be difficult to navigate. With all of these factors in play, engaging a professional custom home builder is essential for ensuring your project runs smoothly and complies with local building codes.

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our custom home construction process is meticulously designed to guide you from concept to completion. Here’s a brief overview of our 11-step process:

1. **Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study**: Before you even think about buying land, we conduct a detailed assessment to ensure the property is buildable, including setback analysis and soil conditions.
2. **Well Permit**: Depending on your water source, filing for a well permit early is crucial, especially in popular areas where drilling schedules can be booked months in advance.
3. **Site Plan**: Our team creates a comprehensive site plan that outlines the positioning of your home, utility routes, and drainage patterns, ensuring compliance with local codes.
4. **Architectural Plans**: We can collaborate with your architect or recommend one from our trusted network or from ArchitecturalDesigns.com, where you can find thousands of ready-made plans.
5. **Engineered Foundation & Framing Plans**: Your plans will be stamped by a licensed engineer, tailored to the specific conditions of your site.
6. **Land Survey**: Essential for determining property boundaries and easements, our professional surveys are part of the permitting process.
7. **Septic System Plans**: If your property is off the sewer grid, we ensure your septic plans are designed per Colorado regulations.
8. **Compile & Submit for Building Permit**: We handle all documentation required by the Park County Building Department to secure your building permit.
9. **Pre-Construction Planning**: Before breaking ground, we finalize plans, schedule subcontractors, and establish a construction timeline.
10. **Construction**: Once construction begins, we manage each phase diligently, ensuring quality and compliance at every step.
11. **Certificate of Occupancy**: After passing all final inspections, we secure your CO, allowing you to move into your new mountain home!

This entire process may take several months for pre-construction and 10 to 18 months for the actual build, depending on various factors like site conditions and the complexity of your project.

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Shawnee</h2>
When considering building a custom home in Shawnee, it’s important to understand the cost dynamics involved. The average cost per square foot typically ranges from $550-$700 for custom or higher-end homes due to the unique challenges associated with mountain construction. For instance, if you're planning a 2,500 sq ft home, the total cost could easily be between $1,375,000 and $1,750,000, not including land expenses. 

Water accessibility is a significant cost factor; for cisterns, the size is typically calculated based on your bedroom count (2 people per bedroom x 100 gallons/day). Thus, a three-bedroom home would require a cistern capable of holding 6,000 gallons, costing between $25,000 and $75,000 installed.

Additionally, rocky terrain and limited access can increase costs for excavation and foundation work, sometimes adding thousands to the project. It's crucial to budget for unexpected expenses, as building in this area often involves navigating various regulatory hurdles and ensuring compliance with Park County building codes.
