<h2 id="why-professional">Why Johnson Village Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
Building a custom home in Johnson Village, nestled at an elevation of over 8,000 feet in Chaffee County, requires specialized knowledge and expertise that only a professional custom home builder can provide. The terrain, with its rocky granite and clay soils, presents unique challenges that can complicate home construction. A licensed general contractor like Tri-Lakes Contracting understands these complexities, ensuring that your home is not only beautifully designed but also structurally sound against the elements. From navigating local building permit requirements to creating energy-efficient homes that withstand heavy snow loads and extreme temperature swings, our team is equipped to handle every aspect of your new construction project.

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Chaffee County County</h2>
Chaffee County’s mountainous terrain and high elevation create distinct challenges for home construction in Johnson Village. **Soil conditions** often include rocky granite and decomposed granite, necessitating specialized foundation engineering to ensure stability and safety. Additionally, the **water table** in this area can be quite deep, making **cisterns** a common solution for water needs. Most properties require engineered septic systems due to challenging soil, which adds another layer of complexity. With a **frost line** that ranges from 36 to 48 inches, proper foundation depth is crucial. Furthermore, the building season typically runs from May to October, with limited access during winter months due to steep driveways and heavy snowfall. Each of these factors must be carefully evaluated during the planning stages of your custom home construction.

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our custom home construction process is designed to guide you step-by-step, ensuring that every detail is meticulously addressed. 

1. **Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study**: Before acquiring land, it’s vital to conduct a feasibility study to assess site conditions, zoning issues, and potential costs. This step saves you from unexpected challenges later.
  
2. **Well Permit**: If your property doesn't have a water source, obtaining a well permit early is essential since it can take months to secure drilling schedules. If you opt for a cistern, you'll still need a permit on file.

3. **Site Plan Development**: Our team prepares a detailed site plan, indicating the orientation of your home, access routes, and utility placements. This plan is crucial for obtaining necessary building permits.

4. **Architectural Plans**: You can choose to work with your own architect, use our recommended professionals, or select from thousands of designs available at ArchitecturalDesigns.com.

5. **Foundation & Framing Plans**: These plans will be stamped by licensed engineers to ensure they meet Colorado’s stringent building codes, particularly regarding snow and wind loads.

6. **Land Survey**: A professional survey confirms property boundaries and identifies any easements.

7. **Septic System Plans**: If there is no sewer connection, engineered septic plans are essential, often requiring soil testing and design approval.

8. **Compile & Submit for Building Permit**: We handle all the necessary documentation for a building permit through the Chaffee County Building Department, ensuring compliance with local regulations.

9. **Pre-Construction Planning**: Before we break ground, we finalize construction schedules, budgets, and material orders.

10. **Construction**: The actual building process begins, including multiple inspections to ensure quality standards.

11. **Certificate of Occupancy**: Upon passing all final inspections, we secure your certificate, allowing you to move into your new mountain home.

This comprehensive approach typically spans 2-6 months for planning and another 10-18 months for construction, depending on the complexity of your project.

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Johnson Village</h2>
The cost of building a custom home in Johnson Village is influenced by various factors, including site conditions, design complexity, and local regulations. On average, you can expect to pay between **$450 and $700 per square foot** for a standard to high-end home, reflecting the unique challenges of mountain construction. For instance, if you’re planning a 2,500 square foot luxury build, your total costs could range from **$1,375,000 to $1,750,000+**.

One aspect often overlooked is the need for **cisterns**. For households, the general guideline is to size your cistern based on the number of bedrooms: multiply the bedroom count by two people per bedroom, then by 100 gallons per day. For example, a three-bedroom home would need a cistern capable of holding at least **6,000 gallons** to meet daily needs.

Additional costs to consider include:
- **Land Acquisition**: Not included in above estimates.
- **Cistern Installation**: $25,000 - $75,000
- **Well Drilling**: $30,000 - $80,000+
- **Septic Installation**: $35,000 - $80,000
- **Driveway Construction**: $10,000 - $50,000

Keep in mind that costs can escalate significantly in rocky or difficult terrains, so it’s best to budget at the higher end of these ranges.
