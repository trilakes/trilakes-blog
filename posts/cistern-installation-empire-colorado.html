<h2 id="why-professional">Why Empire Properties Need Professional Cistern Installation</h2>
<p>In the picturesque mountain community of Empire, where elevations soar above 8,000 feet, the need for reliable water sources is crucial. Many properties in this stunning area do not have access to traditional well systems due to deep water tables and rocky terrain. This is where professional <strong>cistern installation</strong> comes into play. With the right expertise, homeowners can ensure a dependable supply of potable water through underground storage tanks, even in the most challenging environments. At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we understand the specific needs of Empire’s properties and are equipped to provide solutions tailored to your unique requirements, ensuring that you won't run short of water, especially during the harsh Colorado winters.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Clear Creek County</h2>
<p>Empire, located in Clear Creek County, presents unique challenges for water supply solutions. The rocky granite and clay soils complicate installation, often necessitating engineered septic systems due to their challenging nature. With the water table frequently situated deep below the surface, many residents must rely on <strong>water hauling</strong> or install an <strong>underground water storage tank</strong> for their needs. Additionally, the frost line at elevations of 8,000+ feet can reach depths of 36 to 48 inches, making it critical to properly winterize your <strong>cistern installation</strong>. Access to many properties can be steep and limited during winter months, which adds to the complexity of maintaining a reliable water supply. Furthermore, the region is prone to extreme weather conditions, including heavy snowfall and afternoon thunderstorms, making it essential to have a robust <strong>water storage solution</strong> in place, particularly for fire suppression and backup supply.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Cistern Installation Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our <strong>cistern installation</strong> process is thorough and tailored to meet the specific needs of your Empire property. Here's a step-by-step overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> We start with a detailed consultation to understand your water needs, property layout, and any specific challenges presented by your site.</li>
<li><strong>Site Assessment:</strong> We conduct a thorough assessment of your land, including soil analysis and elevation considerations, to determine the best installation location.</li>
<li><strong>Permitting:</strong> All necessary permits must be obtained from the Clear Creek County Building Department. We handle this process to ensure compliance with local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Excavation:</strong> Our team will begin excavation of the site, taking into account any rocky terrain that may increase costs and timelines.</li>
<li><strong>Tank Installation:</strong> We install the chosen <strong>buried water tank</strong>—typically a Norwesco tank—ensuring it is properly connected to your home’s plumbing system.</li>
<li><strong>Winterization:</strong> Given the colder climate, we ensure that your system is adequately winterized to avoid freeze damage.</li>
<li><strong>Final Inspection:</strong> After installation, we conduct a final inspection to ensure everything is functioning correctly and meets local codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process typically takes several weeks, depending on site conditions and weather, but we aim to make it as seamless as possible.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Cistern Installation in Empire</h2>
<p>The cost of <strong>cistern installation</strong> in Empire can vary significantly based on several factors. The first consideration is the size of the <strong>underground water storage tank</strong> you need, which depends on your daily water usage. For example, a typical calculation is based on bedroom count: assume two people per bedroom at 100 gallons per day. Thus, a 3-bedroom home would require around 600 gallons daily.</p>
<p>Next, consider how often you want to refill your tank. If you prefer refills every month, you will need a minimum of 18,000 gallons, while a system designed to get you through the winter could require 72,000 gallons or more.</p>
<p>Here are some typical costs you might expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norwesco 5,000 gallon tank: $13,000-$15,000</li>
<li>Norwesco 10,000 gallon tank: $22,000-$28,000</li>
<li>Excavation costs: $3,000-$8,000+, influenced by rocky terrain</li>
<li>Pump system & pressure tank installation: $2,500-$5,000</li>
<li>Total installed costs for a 5,000-gallon system can range from $25,000-$35,000, while a 10,000-gallon system can be $40,000-$55,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s crucial to note that rocky or challenging terrain can add 20-40% to excavation costs, and winter installations generally incur higher costs due to ground conditions. For ongoing water hauling, expect to pay around $200-$350 for every 3,000 gallons delivered. A larger tank reduces the frequency of deliveries, offering long-term savings and convenience.</p>

<div class="faq-item"><h3>Q: What size underground water storage tank do I need?</h3><p>A: The size of your underground water storage tank depends on your daily water usage and how frequently you want to refill it.
