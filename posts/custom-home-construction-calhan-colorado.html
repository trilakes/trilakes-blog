<h2 id="why-professional">Why Calhan Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
<p>Building a <strong>custom home</strong> in Calhan, nestled at an elevation of over 8,000 feet, presents unique opportunities and challenges. The mountain terrain and specific climatic conditions necessitate a professional approach to ensure that your <strong>home construction</strong> project is not only beautiful but also functional and enduring. A licensed and insured <strong>general contractor</strong> like Tri-Lakes Contracting can help you navigate the complex landscape of building permits, site planning, and construction challenges specific to this region, ensuring that your dream home is built to withstand the elements while maximizing comfort and aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in El Paso County</h2>
<p>Calhan's distinct geological features, including rocky granite and clay soils, present significant challenges for residential construction. The <strong>water table</strong> in this area is often quite deep, requiring homeowners to consider options like cisterns or water hauling to ensure a reliable water supply. Additionally, the <strong>frost line</strong> can reach depths of 36 to 48 inches, necessitating careful planning for <strong>foundation engineering</strong>. The steep driveways and limited access during winter months can complicate construction logistics, while the risk of heavy snow loads and afternoon thunderstorms requires thorough structural planning. Understanding these local challenges is crucial for anyone looking to build in this picturesque yet demanding environment.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a detailed and systematic approach to ensure your <strong>new construction</strong> project is a success. Here’s how our process unfolds:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study:</strong> Before you even buy land, we conduct a <a href="/blog/build-feasibility-report-colorado.html">Build Feasibility Report</a> to assess site conditions, setbacks, and overall buildability. This critical first step can save you from costly surprises down the road.</li>
<li><strong>Water Permit Filing:</strong> Whether you choose a well or a cistern, filing for a water permit is essential before we can obtain a building permit.</li>
<li><strong>Site Plan Development:</strong> We create a comprehensive site plan that outlines the positioning of your home, driveway, utilities, and septic system, ensuring compliance with local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural Plans:</strong> With your input, we design your home using either your architect or our network of recommended architects, including options from <a href="https://www.architecturaldesigns.com" target="_blank">ArchitecturalDesigns.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering Plans:</strong> We develop <strong>foundation</strong> and <strong>framing plans</strong> that are tailored to your site’s specific conditions and stamped by licensed engineers.</li>
<li><strong>Land Survey:</strong> A professional survey verifies property boundaries and easements, which is crucial for permitting.</li>
<li><strong>Septic System Planning:</strong> If your property is not connected to a sewer, we will prepare engineered septic plans that comply with local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Building Permit Submission:</strong> We compile all necessary documents and submit them to the El Paso County Building Department, taking care of all permit fees and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Construction Planning:</strong> Prior to breaking ground, we conduct a final review with you to confirm materials, schedules, and budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Construction Phase:</strong> Construction begins with site preparation and progresses through various phases, including inspections at each stage.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate of Occupancy:</strong> Once construction is complete and passes final inspections, we secure your Certificate of Occupancy, allowing you to move in!</li>
</ol>
<p>This detailed and structured approach ensures that your custom home is built to the highest standards while adhering to all local regulations and requirements.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Calhan</h2>
<p>When considering the investment in a custom home, understanding the cost factors is essential. The cost per square foot for <strong>custom home construction</strong> in Colorado mountain communities like Calhan typically ranges from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Build:</strong> $350-$450/sq ft</li>
<li><strong>Standard Quality:</strong> $450-$550/sq ft</li>
<li><strong>Custom/Higher-End:</strong> $550-$700/sq ft</li>
<li><strong>Luxury/High-End:</strong> $700-$1,000+/sq ft</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a 2,500 sq ft home could cost anywhere from $875,000 to $1,375,000, depending on the level of finish and complexity of design. Additional costs for essential systems like cisterns can range from $25,000 to $75,000, while septic installation could be between $35,000 and $80,000. A crucial aspect to consider for cistern sizing is based on your bedroom count: two people per bedroom multiplied by 100 gallons per day.</p>
<p>Moreover, factors like rocky terrain, site access, and elevated frost lines can significantly increase construction costs. It's advisable to quote the higher end of these ranges to avoid financial surprises.</p>
