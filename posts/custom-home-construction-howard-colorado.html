<h2 id="why-professional">Why Howard Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
<p>Building a custom home in Howard, Fremont County, comes with unique opportunities and challenges. At elevations exceeding 8,000 feet, the stunning Colorado mountain views are complemented by the intricacies of constructing on rocky terrain, with soil types ranging from decomposed granite to clay in the valleys. Engaging a licensed and insured <strong>custom home builder</strong> like Tri-Lakes Contracting ensures you have expert guidance every step of the way, from navigating local building codes to managing the weather's impact on your <strong>new construction</strong>. Our experience in the region allows us to bring your vision to life while ensuring adherence to best practices, making the home building process seamless and stress-free.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Fremont County</h2>
<p>Fremont County's geographical and climatic conditions present a unique set of challenges for <strong>home construction</strong>. The elevation of over 8,000 feet means homeowners must prepare for extreme temperature swings and heavy snow loads during winter months. Soil conditions are particularly tricky; rocky granite can complicate foundation engineering, and many properties require engineered septic systems due to challenging soil composition. Additionally, the frost line here reaches depths of 36-48 inches, necessitating specialized foundation designs. The steep driveways and limited winter access can also hinder construction timelines. Understanding these local challenges is crucial for any <strong>general contractor</strong> to ensure your dream mountain home is not only beautiful but also structurally sound and livable year-round.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we have streamlined our <strong>custom home construction</strong> process to ensure clarity and efficiency. Below are the key steps we follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study</strong> - Before you buy land, we assess site conditions, setbacks, and utility availability to confirm it's buildable.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Well Permit</strong> - Securing a well permit is vital in Fremont County, as many properties require proof of water before obtaining a building permit.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3: Site Plan</strong> - Our in-house team prepares a professional site plan that includes the position of your house, utility routes, and drainage patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4: Architectural Plans</strong> - Choose from our network of architects or explore ready-made plans at <a href="https://www.architecturaldesigns.com" target="_blank">ArchitecturalDesigns.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5: Engineered Foundation & Framing Plans</strong> - Stamped plans ensure your structure meets Colorado’s building codes.</li>
<li><strong>Step 6: Land Survey</strong> - We conduct a thorough land survey to confirm property boundaries and easements.</li>
<li><strong>Step 7: Septic System Plans</strong> - If a sewer connection is unavailable, we will create a design for an engineered septic system.</li>
<li><strong>Step 8: Compile & Submit for Building Permit</strong> - We handle all the required documentation for the Fremont County Building Department.</li>
<li><strong>Step 9: Pre-Construction Planning</strong> - We finalize schedules, subcontractor bids, and materials.</li>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Howard</h2>
<p>When considering a <strong>custom home build</strong> in Howard, it's crucial to understand the financial implications. The average cost per square foot for mountain construction ranges from <strong>$550 to $700</strong> for custom builds, with luxury options reaching upwards of <strong>$1,000</strong> per square foot. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,500 sq ft: <strong>$825,000</strong></li>
<li>2,000 sq ft: <strong>$1,100,000</strong></li>
<li>2,500 sq ft: <strong>$1,375,000</strong></li>
<li>3,000+ sq ft: <strong>$1,750,000+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Additional costs can arise from factors such as rocky terrain, access difficulties, and the need for engineered septic systems, which can range from <strong>$35,000 to $80,000</strong>. If you opt for a cistern, remember to calculate your water needs: each bedroom typically requires 2 people at 100 gallons per day. Therefore, a 3-bedroom home would need a 600-gallon cistern, costing between <strong>$25,000 and $75,000</strong>. Understanding these costs will help you better prepare financially for your new mountain home.</p>
