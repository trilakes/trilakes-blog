<h2 id="why-professional">Why Tarryall Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
<p>Tarryall, located in the breathtaking Park County County, Colorado, offers a unique opportunity for homeowners looking to build a custom mountain home. With an elevation soaring over 8,000 feet, the area presents stunning views, abundant wildlife, and a serene atmosphere. However, these advantages come with inherent challenges that make professional <strong>home construction</strong> services essential. The local terrain can be rocky and uneven, and the weather can fluctuate dramatically, making it critical to work with a licensed and insured <strong>general contractor</strong> like Tri-Lakes Contracting. Our expertise in custom home building ensures your project is not only beautiful but also structurally sound and compliant with local regulations.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Park County County</h2>
<p>Building in Tarryall presents several challenges that require specialized knowledge and skills. The soil is typically rocky granite or decomposed granite, and in the valleys, clay can pose additional complications. Understanding these soil conditions is crucial for foundation engineering, as many homes will need to utilize engineered systems for septic installation due to the challenging soil composition. Moreover, the frost line at this elevation reaches depths of 36-48 inches, necessitating careful planning during the foundation stage. </p>
<p>In addition, the building season is often limited to May through October at higher elevations, which can affect your <strong>construction timeline</strong>. Access to many properties can be steep and treacherous, particularly in winter, emphasizing the need for a well-planned driveway and potential snow removal strategies. Lastly, fire mitigation is critical in forested areas, requiring a defensible space to protect your investment, particularly as extreme temperature swings and heavy snowfall can impact building integrity.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we follow a detailed, step-by-step process to ensure your custom home is built to your specifications and the highest standards:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study:</strong> Before you finalize your land purchase, we recommend obtaining a <a href="/blog/build-feasibility-report-colorado.html">Build Feasibility Report</a>. This includes a site visit, setback analysis, and soil condition assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Well Permit:</strong> Filing your well permit early is crucial as many areas face lengthy wait times for well drilling.</li>
<li><strong>Site Plan:</strong> We create a comprehensive site plan that outlines the house footprint, utility routes, and drainage patterns, ensuring everything is in compliance with local regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural Plans:</strong> You can choose to work with your own architect or utilize our network, including options available on <a href="https://www.architecturaldesigns.com" target="_blank">ArchitecturalDesigns.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Engineered Foundation & Framing Plans:</strong> All plans are stamped by a licensed engineer to meet Colorado’s stringent standards.</li>
<li><strong>Land Survey:</strong> A professional survey is required to verify property boundaries and easements.</li>
<li><strong>Septic System Plans:</strong> If a sewer connection is not available, we will ensure engineered septic plans are in place.</li>
<li><strong>Compile & Submit for Building Permit:</strong> We compile all necessary documents for your building permit submission to the Park County County building department.</li>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Tarryall</h2>
<p>When considering a custom home in Tarryall, it’s essential to understand the associated costs. Generally, the cost per square foot for construction ranges from <strong>$350-$1,000+</strong>, depending on quality and complexity. For example, a basic build is estimated at around $350-$450 per square foot, while luxury builds can exceed $1,000 per square foot. </p>
<p>For cisterns, the size is typically based on the number of bedrooms in the home: two people per bedroom, using 100 gallons of water per day. Therefore, if you plan for a three-bedroom home, you would need a cistern that holds approximately 6,000 gallons (3 bedrooms x 2 people x 100 gallons/day x 30 days). Keep in mind that challenging terrain, rocky soil, and steep access can further increase costs significantly. </p>
<p>Additional costs to consider include land acquisition, septic installation ($35,000-$80,000), and driveway development ($10,000-$50,000). Overall, building a custom home in Tarryall can range from about $525,000 for a 1,500 square foot home to over $3,000,000 for high-end luxury builds.</p>
