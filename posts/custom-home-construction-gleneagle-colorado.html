<h2 id="why-professional">Why Gleneagle Properties Need Professional Custom Home Construction</h2>
Building a custom home in Gleneagle, Colorado, is not just about picking a design; it’s about crafting a mountain retreat that withstands the unique challenges of the high elevation and rugged terrain. At over 8,000 feet, the climate can shift drastically, and the landscape presents various obstacles that require professional insight. As a licensed and insured general contractor, Tri-Lakes Contracting understands the intricacies involved in home construction in this mountain community. By working with a professional custom home builder, you ensure that your dream home is not only aesthetically pleasing but also structurally sound, energy efficient, and compliant with local building codes.

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in El Paso County</h2>
Building in Gleneagle presents distinct challenges that require specialized knowledge. The soil varies from rocky granite to decomposed granite and even clay in the valleys, making foundation engineering a crucial aspect of your home construction. At high elevations, the frost line can reach depths of 36 to 48 inches, complicating foundation work. Furthermore, the water table is often deep, meaning many properties need cisterns for water supply—this can significantly impact site planning. The area’s steep driveways can limit access during winter months, and heavy snowfall can add stress to the structural requirements of your home. Fire mitigation is also a critical concern in forested areas, where defensible space requirements must be met to ensure safety.

<h2 id="our-process">Our Custom Home Construction Process</h2>
At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our custom home construction process is designed to guide you through every step, ensuring a smooth experience. Here’s how it works:

1. **Pre-Purchase Build Feasibility Study**: Before acquiring land, we perform a feasibility study that includes a site visit, setback analysis, and soil condition assessment, among other critical evaluations.
2. **Well Permit Application**: If opting for a well, file your permit early. Waiting lists can extend for months, and having this permit on file is essential for obtaining a building permit.
3. **Site Planning**: We create a detailed site plan that outlines where everything goes on your property, including the house footprint and utility routes.
4. **Architectural Plans**: You can bring your architect, use one of our trusted partners, or choose from thousands of designs at ArchitecturalDesigns.com.
5. **Foundation and Framing Plans**: These engineered plans will be stamped by licensed professionals, tailored to your specific site conditions.
6. **Land Survey**: A professional survey is essential for verifying property boundaries and identifying easements.
7. **Septic System Plans**: If no sewer connection is available, we design an engineered septic system that meets Colorado regulations.
8. **Building Permit Submission**: We compile and submit all necessary documentation to the El Paso County building department to secure your building permit.
9. **Pre-Construction Planning**: Before construction begins, we finalize plans, materials, and schedules with you.
10. **Construction**: We manage the construction phase, including inspections at each critical stage.
11. **Certificate of Occupancy**: After passing the final inspection, we handover your keys and issue a certificate of occupancy.

Our process typically spans 10-18 months for construction, considering the elevation and weather conditions.

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Custom Home Construction in Gleneagle</h2>
When planning your custom home construction in Gleneagle, it’s crucial to consider the associated costs. The average cost per square foot ranges from $550 to $700 for a custom build, and can be higher for luxury homes, reaching $1,000+ per square foot. For example, a 2,500 square foot custom home could cost approximately $1,375,000 or more, depending on site conditions and design complexity.

If you are considering a cistern for water, it’s essential to size it based on your home’s bedroom count—plan for 2 people per bedroom, using 100 gallons per day. Therefore, a home with three bedrooms would require a cistern capable of holding at least 6,000 gallons. Costs for cistern installations typically range from $25,000 to $75,000, depending on site accessibility and soil conditions.

Additional expenses may include septic installation, which can be $35,000 to $80,000, and utility extensions that vary widely based on distance and requirements. Given the rocky terrain and steep driveways often found in Gleneagle, it’s critical to budget for potential access challenges that can escalate costs.
