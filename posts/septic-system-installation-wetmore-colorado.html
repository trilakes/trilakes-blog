<h2 id="why-professional">Why Wetmore Properties Need Professional Septic System Installation</h2>
<p>In the beautiful mountain community of Wetmore, Colorado, with elevations exceeding 8,000 feet, having a reliable and properly installed <strong>septic system</strong> is crucial. The unique terrain and challenging soil conditions often require expertise to ensure that your <strong>septic installation</strong> meets local regulations and performs efficiently. Attempting to install a <strong>septic tank</strong> without professional assistance can lead to costly mistakes and unwanted complications, especially given the area's rocky granite and clay soils. At Tri-Lakes Contracting, we understand the local challenges and have extensive knowledge of Colorado's <strong>Regulation 43</strong>, which governs all <strong>onsite wastewater</strong> systems in the state.</p>

<h2 id="local-challenges">Local Challenges in Custer County</h2>
<p>Wetmore's mountainous terrain presents several challenges when it comes to <strong>septic system installation</strong>. The soil is often rocky, composed of granite and clay, which complicates the design and installation of effective <strong>leach fields</strong> or <strong>drain fields</strong>. Additionally, the water table in this region tends to be quite deep, necessitating the use of cisterns and water hauling for many properties. The frost line here reaches depths of 36-48 inches, posing a further challenge during installations, especially in winter months. Access can be limited due to steep driveways and heavy snowfall, making it imperative to choose an experienced <strong>septic installer near me</strong> who understands these conditions.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our Septic System Installation Process</h2>  
<p>At Tri-Lakes Contracting, our <strong>septic system installation</strong> process begins with a thorough assessment of your property. First, we perform <strong>soil testing</strong> to determine the best system for your site. This involves digging two test holes, each 8 feet deep, to collect samples that will be analyzed by a licensed engineer. Based on the soil report, we can recommend the most appropriate system type, which is often an engineered system due to local soil conditions.</p>
<p>Once we receive the soils report, we assist you in obtaining the necessary <strong>septic permit</strong> from the Custer County Building Department. This step is essential, as all permits must go through this office. After securing the permits, we typically schedule the installation during the building season, which runs from May to October at this elevation.</p>
<p>The actual installation starts with excavation, where we prepare the site for the <strong>septic tank</strong> and any necessary leach fields. Depending on the system, this can involve installing a pressure-dosed system or a sand filter system. Once everything is in place, we conduct a final inspection to ensure compliance with local regulations. Our goal is to provide you with a fully functional, efficient, and long-lasting <strong>onsite wastewater</strong> treatment solution.</p>

<h2 id="cost-factors">Cost Factors for Septic System Installation in Wetmore</h2>
<p>Understanding the costs associated with <strong>septic installation</strong> is crucial for homeowners in Wetmore. The pricing for engineered systems typically starts at around $35,000 and can go up to $80,000+, depending on site conditions and system types. For example, basic engineered systems range from $35,000-$50,000, while advanced treatment units (ATUs) can range from $55,000-$80,000, especially if rocky terrain adds complexity to the installation.</p>
<p>When calculating the size of your cistern, remember that the formula is based on the number of bedrooms: 2 people per bedroom multiplied by 100 gallons per day. This can significantly impact the overall cost, as larger cisterns will require more extensive excavation and installation work.</p>
<p>Additional factors that might influence costs include the need for a sand filter system, which typically costs between $45,000-$65,000, and the difficulty of accessing your property. Steep driveways and challenging weather conditions can further elevate expenses. We recommend budgeting for permits, which can vary from $500-$2,000, and additional costs for excavation that can range from $8,000-$20,000+ depending on site conditions.
