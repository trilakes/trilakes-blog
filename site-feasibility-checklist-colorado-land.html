<h2>Your Complete Site Feasibility Checklist</h2>
<p>Print this out and take it with you when evaluating land. These 25 items can save you from a costly mistake.</p>

<h3>WATER (Questions 1-5)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>What are neighboring well depths?</strong> 
        <p>Checking the depth of neighboring wells can give you a good indication of how deep you may need to drill to find water. The Colorado well permits database is a vital resource for this information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are there any dry holes in the area?</strong> 
        <p>Understanding the history of drilling in the area can help you avoid purchasing land in a location where water access is unreliable. Dry holes can indicate a lack of groundwater.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What's the typical water flow rate?</strong> 
        <p>A good flow rate is essential for any residential use, from drinking water to irrigation. Knowing the average flow rate can help you gauge if the property will meet your needs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is cistern delivery accessible if needed?</strong> 
        <p>If well water is not available, understanding cistern delivery options will help you plan for water storage and ensure you have a reliable supply.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are there any water rights or shares included?</strong> 
        <p>Water rights in Colorado can be complex. Knowing if the land comes with any water rights or shares can greatly affect the value and usability of the land.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>SEPTIC (Questions 6-10)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Can you get a perc test before purchase?</strong> 
        <p>A perc test determines how well the soil drains, which is crucial for septic system installation. Without it, you may face costly modifications later.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What soil type is present?</strong> 
        <p>Different soil types can affect drainage and the type of septic system you may need. This knowledge helps avoid potential problems down the line.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is there adequate space for a drain field?</strong> 
        <p>Your septic system requires a drain field area that meets local regulations. Inadequate space can lead to significant extra costs or even make the land unbuildable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What setbacks apply?</strong> 
        <p>Setback regulations dictate how far the septic system must be from structures and water sources. Knowing these can save you from future legal issues.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Would an engineered system be likely required?</strong> 
        <p>If the soil or site conditions are less than ideal, an engineered system may be necessary, which can be significantly more expensive than traditional septic systems.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>ACCESS (Questions 11-15)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Is there legal deeded access?</strong> 
        <p>Legal access is essential for enjoying your property. Without it, you could face challenges in reaching your land, or worse, legal disputes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is the road maintained?</strong> 
        <p>If the access road is not maintained, it can become impassable during snow or storms, affecting your ability to reach your home or receive deliveries.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is it accessible year-round?</strong> 
        <p>Year-round accessibility is crucial, especially in Colorado's mountainous regions where winter conditions can be severe. Ensure that you can reach your property in all seasons.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Can construction equipment reach the site?</strong> 
        <p>If construction equipment cannot access the site easily, it may increase building costs and complicate your plans for development.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What would driveway construction cost?</strong> 
        <p>Understanding the cost of building a driveway is vital for budgeting your overall project. A long or difficult access route can significantly increase expenses.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>BUILDABILITY (Questions 16-20)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>What's the slope percentage?</strong> 
        <p>Slope affects not only the aesthetics and usability of the land but also the cost and feasibility of building. Steep slopes may require additional engineering and safety measures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is there a buildable flat(ish) area?</strong> 
        <p>Having a flat area to build on makes construction easier and more cost-effective. A lack of suitable land can limit your building options.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What are the county setback requirements?</strong> 
        <p>Setback requirements dictate how far structures must be from property lines, roads, and other features. Not adhering to these can result in costly fines or removal of your structure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are there utility easements?</strong> 
        <p>Utility easements may limit where you can build on your property. Knowing their locations early helps avoid potential conflicts with utility companies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Any wetlands, flood zones, or restrictions?</strong> 
        <p>Wetlands and flood zones can severely limit what you can do with your land. Identifying these issues upfront is essential for planning and avoiding future problems.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>UTILITIES (Questions 21-25)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>How far is electric service?</strong> 
        <p>The proximity to electric service affects your costs for connecting power to your home. Long distances can lead to significant installation expenses.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Is propane delivery accessible?</strong> 
        <p>If you're relying on propane for heating or cooking, understanding delivery options is crucial for ensuring consistent access to fuel.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What internet options exist?</strong> 
        <p>Internet access is vital, especially if you plan to work from home or enjoy digital amenities. Knowing available options will help you stay connected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cell phone coverage?</strong> 
        <p>Reliable cell phone coverage is essential for safety and communication, especially in remote areas. Check with providers to ensure your needs will be met.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What's the total utility connection estimate?</strong> 
        <p>Understanding overall utility connection costs is critical for budgeting your entire project. These costs can rise quickly if not planned for in advance.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
