Purchasing land in Colorado's mountainous regions is an exciting venture, but it's crucial to understand the water table depth before making a decision. The depth of the water table can significantly affect your land use, costs, and overall satisfaction. This guide will provide you with essential insights regarding well depths in Colorado, the implications of drilling, and alternative water supply options like cisterns.

## Why Well Depth Matters Before You Buy

Knowing the water table depth is one of the most critical factors to consider before purchasing mountain land in Colorado. The depth at which you can access water can vary widely and directly influences the costs associated with drilling a well. Drilling a well typically costs between $20 to $50 or more per foot. For instance, if the water table is located 500 feet below the surface, you could be looking at a total drilling cost of anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000 or more, just for the drilling itself. 

Beyond drilling costs, you'll also need to factor in additional expenses such as the pump, pressure tank, and ongoing maintenance. And perhaps most concerning, there is no guarantee that you will find water at the end of your drilling endeavor. In some cases, people have drilled dry holes, incurring significant expenses without attaining the water source they need. 

Understanding well depth is essential for budgeting and planning your property developments, making it necessary to conduct thorough research before committing to a purchase. This knowledge can save you from unexpected financial strain and help you make informed decisions.

## Typical Well Depths by Area

Water table depths in Colorado mountain areas vary widely based on geography and geology. Here are some general ballpark ranges for different counties:

- **Teller County**: Well depths often range from 200 to 600 feet, with some areas reaching 800 feet or more.
- **Park County**: The depth can be highly variable, commonly found between 150 to 800 feet.
- **El Paso County Foothills**: A typical range for well depths is between 200 to 500 feet.

The variability in well depths across different regions can be attributed to several factors, including local geology and the presence of aquifers. Mountainous areas may have fractured rock formations that can affect water flow, while valleys may have more accessible water sources. Understanding the geological context of the area you're considering can help you anticipate potential challenges and costs related to drilling.

## How to Research Well Depths Before Buying

Before you commit to purchasing mountain land, it’s essential to conduct thorough research on well depths in the area. Here are a few effective strategies:

1. **Colorado Well Permit Database**: This public record allows you to find information on existing wells, including depths and water quality.
   
2. **Look Up Neighboring Property Wells**: Investigating the well depths of neighboring properties can provide valuable insights into what you can expect for your own land.

3. **Speak to Neighbors**: Engaging with current residents can yield firsthand knowledge about the area's water table and any challenges they may have faced.

4. **Consult Local Well Drillers**: Professionals in the area can provide estimates based on their experience and knowledge of the local geology.

## When a Cistern Makes More Sense

In some circumstances, drilling a well may not be the best option. If you're considering a property with a deep or uncertain water table, or if it's located in known dry areas, a cistern could be a more viable solution. Cisterns allow you to collect and store water, making it possible to manage your water supply without the gamble of drilling.

Cisterns can provide predictable costs compared to the often unpredictable expenses associated with drilling a well. Many mountain properties effectively use cisterns to ensure a consistent water supply, particularly in areas where well depths can be prohibitively deep.

## Questions to Ask Before Buying

Before finalizing your purchase, ensure you ask the following questions to assess the viability of water access:

1. **Did neighbors find water?**
2. **At what depth did they find it?**
3. **What's the flow rate of their wells?**
4. **Have there been any dry holes drilled in the area?**

These inquiries can help paint a clearer picture of the water situation in your potential new neighborhood, allowing you to make a more informed decision.
